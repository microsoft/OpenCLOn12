// A task is an encapsulation of something that can be submitted to a command queue
// and/or something that can be waited on (i.e. cl_event).
//
// A task goes through several state transitions:
// 1. A task is created in the 'queued' state. This means it's in a command queue
//    but hasn't yet been submitted to the 'device.'
//    It goes through a state transition when its corresponding command queue is flushed.
// 2. After the queue is flushed, the task enteres the 'submitted' state. In this state,
//    the device needs to check conditions on the task before deciding to schedule it.
//    A task can have other tasks that it's dependent on. It stays in this state until
//    those dependencies are satisfied.
// 3. Once all dependencies are satisfied, the task enters the 'ready' state.
//    In the ready state, the work in the task is free to be scheduled by the device
//    whenever the device is ready to execute more work. Note that from the API there
//    is no distinction between the submitted and ready states.
//    Therefore, this state is more like a pseudo-state that only exists in theory.
//    This implementation does not have an explicit notion of this state.
// 4. Once the device has started working on a given task, it enters the 'running' state.
// 5. Once the device finishes all work associated with the task, but not necessarily
//    work that was submitted to a device-side queue by the task, it enters the 'ended' state.
// 6. Once all work associated with the task and its children are done, it enters the 'complete' state.
//    The distinction between ended and complete only matters for tasks which are kernel enqueues,
//    and which submit child kernel executions to a device queue.
//    This implementation does not support device queues.
//
// These state transitions are visible out of the API in two ways, both exposed via events.
// Every time a task is created, the developer has the opportunity to request an event for that task.
// 1. The event can be polled for the current state of the associated task, as well as have
//    callbacks registered on it for event state changes. Neither the 'ready' nor 'ended' state are visible here.
// 2. If the task was submitted to a queue with profiling enabled, then the event can also
//    be queried for profiling information: specifically, the timestamp at which point
//    the task entered a particular state. Note that the 'ready' state does not have a timestamp.
//
// This implementation implements tasks in the following way:
// - Any time an 'enqueue' API is called, a task object is created in the 'queued' state.
// - The task object implements the event API.
// - The task object sits in a command queue.
// - The task has a list of all other tasks that it is dependent on, as well as a list of tasks
//   that are dependent on it.
// --- The list of backward dependencies is pruned as dependencies are satisfied.
// --- The list of forwards dependencies is cleared upon task completion.
// - If a task is submitted to an in-order command queue (TBD whether out-of-order is even supported),
//   then the task immediately preceeding it in the queue is added as a dependency.
// - When a command queue is flushed, all tasks in the queue are submitted to the device and become 'submitted'.
// --- Note that the command queue needs to keep track of what tasks it has submitted but are not yet
//     complete, for the purposes of implementing 'finish', markers, and barriers, as well as specifically
//     the last task that was submitted for in-order queues.
// - Tasks that are submitted with no dependencies are considered 'ready'. Ready tasks are added to a list.
// --- At the end of the flush operation, a work item is created for a worker thread to execute all ready tasks.
// --- After recording all ready tasks into a command list, the command list is submitted, and the thread waits for it to complete.
// --- Then, all tasks that were part of that command list are marked complete. This enables new tasks to be marked ready.
// --- If there are any newly ready tasks, then another worker thread work item is created to execute those.
// --- Note that no barriers are required between tasks recorded into a single command list, because they have no dependencies on each other.
// --- This model is more conformant, and enables latency-hiding for tasks which require additional shader compilations,
//     but will result in less overall throughput.
